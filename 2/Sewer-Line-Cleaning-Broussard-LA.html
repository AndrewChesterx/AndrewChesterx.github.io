<p>Regular reasons for problems in sewer lines are tree root invasion, clogs (such as foreign objects, toilet tissue, grease, and other debris), degeneration, and broken seals or joints in between sections of sewer line. Property owners are responsible for keeping, repairing, and changing natural gas pipes that run from the energy's gas meter to the house's natural gas equipment. When the source of a gas leak or other issue is on a client's natural gas pipe or related connections, repair costs can be high.</p>

Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
