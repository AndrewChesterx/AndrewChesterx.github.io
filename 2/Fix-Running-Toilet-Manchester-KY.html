If you do not identify the smell coming from the sewer backup, you might identify this issue because a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink.

As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
