<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>As toilets age, they have to work more difficult to do their jobs. Harder work implies more water.

If you're worried about your water expense, think about changing your old toilet with a contemporary low-flow model. The brand-new low-flow toilets work simply as effectively as any other type of toilet, and you'll conserve an unexpected quantity on your costs.</p>
