For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
