Read our evaluations to see what individuals are saying about our hot water heater services. If your water heater has actually needed numerous repairs over the last couple of years, it might be time to get it changed. A good guideline for water heaters is this: because the life-span of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
