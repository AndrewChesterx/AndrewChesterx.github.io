Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
