You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

Knowing the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
