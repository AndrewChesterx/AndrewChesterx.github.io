<p>Winter is almost here which suggests you're hectic insulating your home and securing your plumbing from the freezing temperature levels.

It will be much better to cope with a new, more effective system than to spend on frequent repairs.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>As tough water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" sodium ions are launched into the water. Softer clothing without tough minerals trapped in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites remain whiter without the dingy gray triggered by hard water. Please send our thanks to all included with testing, repairing, changing and servicing our softener. Appreciate the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has fixed the issue we were having.</p>
