<p>Typical causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root intrusion, obstructions (such as foreign objects, toilet tissue, grease, and other debris), wear and tear, and broken seals or joints between sections of sewer line. Property owners are accountable for maintaining, fixing, and changing natural gas pipes that run from the energy's gas meter to the home's gas equipment. When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a customer's gas pipe or related connections, repair costs can be high.</p>
