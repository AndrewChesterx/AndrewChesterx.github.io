<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decline in provided pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to escape. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
