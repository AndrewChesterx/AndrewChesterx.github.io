<p>Fixing a faucet or sink itself is often a matter of clearing a clogged drain However, after over 30 years of fixing every make and model of sink and faucet in the Triangle or Sandhills, we can say that there are much more typical problems. Bell Cow is your reliable local plumber and sink repair expert-- from quick repairs to structural repair, we do it all. Be prepared for a more urgent scenario by establishing a relationship with a plumber before you really need him. Hire him to do nonemergency repairs or fixture installations during typical hours if possible.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
