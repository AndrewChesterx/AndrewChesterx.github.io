<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Chesterfield MO</h3>
<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, sink, or bathtub) can be treated easily if the clog is basic and shallow. For a lot of blockages you'll just need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, however if this does not solve the problem then you may likewise need to call in a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to assist.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
