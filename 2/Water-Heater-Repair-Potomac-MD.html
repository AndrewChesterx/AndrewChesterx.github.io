<p>Installation and replacement expenses are often equivalent, though replacement usually will not need additional charges, such as application costs. New meters need to satisfy regulations and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers might need a special meter for their services, limiting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the building permit. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If defective work is found, the inspector will release an infraction notice, and a particular time period is allotted to fix the issue.</p>
