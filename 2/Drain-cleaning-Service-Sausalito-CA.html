<p>You'll need a special garbage disposal if you home utilizes a septic tank and drain field. The unit needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, however needs to then transition to galvanized. I am uncertain why that should be. It is also permitted to use black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized covering (which is generally a special paint"). PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>

The camera will send out a signal when it finds the clog, telling the inspector the precise location.
