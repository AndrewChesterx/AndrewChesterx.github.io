<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
