<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.
