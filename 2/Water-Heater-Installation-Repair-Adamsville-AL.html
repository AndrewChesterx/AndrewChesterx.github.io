<p>Have your assistant hold the flange in place while you situate yourself beneath the sink or lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the top to avoid it from moving.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent to drain. This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully restored.</p>
