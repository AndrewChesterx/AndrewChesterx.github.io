Backflow is the term we use to explain when water reverses flow in its plumbing pipes. Your plumbing system is just designed for water to relocate one direction, but if there's an unexpected change in pressure inside the pipes, it can trigger the water to stream the incorrect method.

<p>Capacity. Capability is critical in selecting the correct hot water heater for your home. A leading factor in correctly sizing your hot water heater is the FHR (first-hour rating) is the variety of gallons of hot water that the hot water heater can supply in an hour when the tank is full. If the hot water heater tank is too small, you won't have adequate hot water to meet your requirements. If it is over-sized, it will warm more water than you use which increases your energy usage and utility costs.
