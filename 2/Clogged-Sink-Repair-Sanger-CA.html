<p>Regardless of the Romans' common use of lead pipes, their aqueducts hardly ever poisoned people. Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had so much calcium in it that a layer of plaque avoided the water contacting the lead itself. What often causes confusion is the big quantity of proof of widespread lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had easy access to piped water, 19 an unfortunate result of lead being used in pots and pans and as an additive to processed food and drink (for instance as a preservative in white wine). 20 Roman lead pipe engravings supplied details on the owner to prevent water theft.</p>
