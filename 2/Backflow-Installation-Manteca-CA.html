<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation of water which may bring dirty water or other, harmful substances into the general public water system and personal plumbing. Backflow can occur in a variety of scenarios that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City supply of water lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
