<p>Lubrication might assist with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the technician assemble the components into the body without developing damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water supply is not infected. Oftentimes the best lube is water. The normal usage for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly lubed to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out earlier by bring in dirt and debris or restricting the motion of the component. The correct quantity of lube ought to make the surface of the 'ring appear damp. You should never ever see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
<p>The check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire protection industry, producing a redundancy developed to ensure that a person check valve will continue to secure the city water supply even if the other fails. This assembly also allows the closure of one valve to lower the pressure differential across the other, creating a more reliable seal and preventing even small backflow leakage. Test cocks, or little ball valves, enable the accessory of testing devices that examines whether the double check assembly is practical.</p>
