<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire combating, causes the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure.

Water will release until the supply side pressure again exceeds the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
