Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
