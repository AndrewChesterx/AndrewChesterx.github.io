This preventative service enables us to identify and resolve potential blockages early before they totally block your drains. Low water pressure in your faucets. Water which sprinkles and sputters out of faucets can be an indicator that some part of your faucet is worn or has been set up incorrectly. Periodically, low water pressure is also related to more major problems with pipes that need to be attended to prior to they become worse.</p>
<p>If you or anybody in the building starts to experience the above noted signs, bear in mind of the location. Then it may be a gas leak, if symptoms afflict people in a particular place.

To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
