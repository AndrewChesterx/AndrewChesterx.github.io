<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals.
