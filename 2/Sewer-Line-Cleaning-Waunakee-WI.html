<p>Backflow prevention measures need to be preserved on-site at all times during building and construction. Temporary water will be permitted after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be securely attached to sturdy rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is significantly complete is prohibited unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and right away evaluated to ensure it is working.</p>
