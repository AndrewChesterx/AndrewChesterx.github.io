<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has actually currently been fouled. Once again, it is a good idea to check the manufacturer's guidelines for special safety measures.</p>
