The disposer unit is heavy and can be awkward to steer beneath the sink. Utilize a big bowl or other strong challenge prop up the system as you place it. Water softeners usually have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly maintained. Ensuring the salt water tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise safeguard the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regeneration cycle and help eliminate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
