<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best 1st experience with the beginning of our house improvements. George and Anthony did a fantastic task for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific needs for our house. I will constantly use them and request George specifically for all future issues or repairs. They were prompt and offered very good prices for what we required done.

Water will release up until the supply side pressure again exceeds the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
