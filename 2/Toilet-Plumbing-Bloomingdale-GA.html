<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. An RP works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be used to isolate health or nonhealth hazards.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide years of protection. There are lots of regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature level can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might seldom need repair while some are fixed on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>
