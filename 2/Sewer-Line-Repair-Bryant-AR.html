<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to split and harden or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
