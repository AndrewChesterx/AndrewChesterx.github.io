<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
