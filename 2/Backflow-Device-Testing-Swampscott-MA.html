When the pressure drops for some factor such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, contaminated water may be drawn into the system. To avoid such an incident, there requires to be some kind of backflow prevention technique made use of. The very best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The appropriate backflow prevention device is needed if an air space is not possible.
