<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may seem like a waste of money. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick? While chemical drain cleaners might be an inexpensive option, the harsh ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, in time, developing vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to rupture. Handling fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings sustained from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
