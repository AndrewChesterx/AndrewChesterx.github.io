<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design).

This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
