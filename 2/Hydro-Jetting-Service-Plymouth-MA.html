<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions.

The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Tough water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>
<p>An rdc resembles a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer consisting of two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves.

An rdc works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage however ought to be used to isolate only nonhealth threats and is planned for use only in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
