<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
