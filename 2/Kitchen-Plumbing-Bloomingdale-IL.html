While there's not a specific schedule regarding when you ought to repipe your house, you must definitely check out repiping if they have not been performed in 50 years or more-- specifically if you live in an older house developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech discuss exactly what was wrong with the unit, how he repaired the issue, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would highly advise Hunter for any issues you might have.</p>
<p>Hydro-jetting is a method of getting rid of develop and particles in tanks and lines by utilizing exceptionally high-pressure water to eliminate blockages.

<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water.

Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I love to prepare, I generate a lot of meals. We set up a momentary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we recognized that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for thirty days. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!
