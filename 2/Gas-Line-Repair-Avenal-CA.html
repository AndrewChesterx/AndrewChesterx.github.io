<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the approach set out above. Since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
