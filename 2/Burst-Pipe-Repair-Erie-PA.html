When the piping in your house begins to reveal any of these signs of deterioration, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the whole plumbing system.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
