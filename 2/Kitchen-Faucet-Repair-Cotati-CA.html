<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Cotati CA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey.

While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous designated uses around your home.</p>
