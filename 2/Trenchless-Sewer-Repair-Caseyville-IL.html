<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the price she paid for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way might have conserved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
