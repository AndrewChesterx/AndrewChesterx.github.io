<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
