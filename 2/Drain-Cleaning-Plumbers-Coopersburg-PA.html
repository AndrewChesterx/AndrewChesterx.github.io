For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the new system, remove the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their equivalents in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you water with potable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and watering, you are likewise required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
