<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more.
