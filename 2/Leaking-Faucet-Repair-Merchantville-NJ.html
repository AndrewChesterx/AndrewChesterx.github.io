These chemicals are easy to use and low-cost, but they damage your pipes and their effects are only short term.

<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
