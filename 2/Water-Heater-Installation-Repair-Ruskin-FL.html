<p>You'll need a special waste disposal unit if you home uses a septic system and drain field. The system needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, however needs to then shift to galvanized. I am unsure why that need to be. It is likewise permitted to use black iron if it is most likely coated with a galvanized finishing (which is generally a special paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E frequently does this.</p>
