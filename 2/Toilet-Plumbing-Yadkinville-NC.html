<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
