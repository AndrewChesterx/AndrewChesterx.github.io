These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply.
