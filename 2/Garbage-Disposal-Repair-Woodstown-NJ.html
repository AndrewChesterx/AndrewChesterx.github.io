<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Main sewer repair involves comprehensive excavation, shoring up supporting walls, relaying and eliminating pipe and connections, backfilling, and installing plates for short-term cover.

Repiping now will provide you assurance and prevent larger leakages down the road.</p>
