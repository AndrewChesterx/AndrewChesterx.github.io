<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Fresno CA</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
