<p>Those of us in the market understand that cross-connection programs in numerous locations have actually greatly minimized the number of reported events that occur within our water systems. This has at times led to people thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never truly have been an issue in the first location. This thinking can be both unsafe and detrimental. Backflow events in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of areas we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow defense. We need to take a look at each installation for the risk it presents and after that install the correct defense.</p>
<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
