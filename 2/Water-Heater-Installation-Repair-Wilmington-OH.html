Age-- As we discussed, a 10+ year old hot water heater is probably on its last legs. If you are not exactly sure how old your unit is, you must have the ability to get that info from the serial number on the producer's sticker label (normally near the top of the unit). Generally, the first two numbers show the year of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>You can find great deals of repair directions on the internet, so the very first thing you need to understand is that for anything beyond an irritating drip-drip-drip you need to close the shutoff valves underneath to save water and secure against the leak suddenly becoming worse while you're asleep or away. You need to also know that except for cosmetically patching a chip in the porcelain and sealing around the joint, there's very little to repair on the sink itself; a problem will indicate a sink replacement.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
