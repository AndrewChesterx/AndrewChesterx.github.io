<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure utilized to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
