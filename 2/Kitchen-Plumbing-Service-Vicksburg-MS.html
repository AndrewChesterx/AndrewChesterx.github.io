<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
