<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
