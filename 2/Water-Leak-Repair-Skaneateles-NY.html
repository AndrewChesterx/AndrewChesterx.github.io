Installation involves over a lots actions, and removing the old one involves even more operations. It can be tough matching up cut outs and component holes, and getting the brand-new installation flat and level with whatever sealed up.</p>

Knowing the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
