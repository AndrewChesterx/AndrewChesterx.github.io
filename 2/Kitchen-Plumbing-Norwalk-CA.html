<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to offer decades of protection. There are numerous local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.
