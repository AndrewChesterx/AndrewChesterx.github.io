<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>

If it is close to the number of years the water heater was ranked for, think about replacement instead of repair.</p>
