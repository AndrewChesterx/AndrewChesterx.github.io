<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>

Like any machine, a sink has multiple parts that need repair and maintenance over time. A plumbing authorization provides for 3 inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections hired on work not finished, not properly installed, or on an unattainable property will require re-inspection. It is the permit holder's responsibility to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the property.</p>
