<p>Note: Copper piping in the Florida area is especially susceptible to recurring pinhole leaks (deterioration that breaks through the surface of piping), so watch out for bluish-greenish corrosion on copper piping. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals feature this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This secures the blades so they don't wear out as quick. All leakages, broken fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, it is very important that you do not put simply anything down your waste disposal unit system. While such units are durable makers, they are not mixers.

Finally, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to guarantee that all food particles have been washed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
