<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that ought to likewise be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl.
