<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
