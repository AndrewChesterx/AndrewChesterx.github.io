Usually, this would include the water service connection to each dedicated fire security system or watering piping system and the water service connection to each of the following types of premises: (1) facilities with an auxiliary or reclaimed water supply; (2) commercial, medical, laboratory, marine or other centers where objectionable substances are managed in a way that might cause pollution or contamination of the public water supply; (3) facilities exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and properties where an internal backflow prevention assembly needed under the State Plumbing Code is not correctly set up or kept; (4) categorized or restricted centers; and (5) high buildings.</p>

<h3>Need A Plumber Service Matthews NC</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>If you are in a position that you discover the indications of a gas line leak, the most important thing to do is to get out of your house as quickly as possible.
