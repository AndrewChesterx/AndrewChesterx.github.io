<p>When the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
