This thinking can be both harmful and counterproductive. Backflow occurrences in water systems are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing method to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the risk it provides and then install the proper security.</p>
