<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
