<p>Take a look at the water heater repair and installation services we provide. Our objective at Brennan Heating & Air Conditioning is to ensure that our Bellevue clients have reliable hot water whenever they need it. The CareSoft ® system was developed with the same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that delivers high-performance solidity elimination you can rely on for several years to come. It's pretty common for particles to end up being flushed down our drains. Think about how frequently food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our sinks and showers. After adequate time, these items might build up into obstructions, which can block the flow of water throughout a home. This can cause numerous problems, from nasty stenches to water leakages and burst pipes.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully restored.</p>
