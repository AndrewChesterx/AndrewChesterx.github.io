As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its many intended uses around your house.</p>
