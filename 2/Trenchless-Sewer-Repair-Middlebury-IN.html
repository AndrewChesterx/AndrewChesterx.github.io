<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Middlebury IN?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
