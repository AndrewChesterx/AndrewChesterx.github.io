Although it's a big job, changing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, utility, or basement  room is fairly simple, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets should definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up requiring to be effectively re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
