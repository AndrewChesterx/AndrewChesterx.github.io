<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or damaged, it could wreak unwanted issues on your property. When your sink is surrounded by granite, marble, quartz, and others, the product can get harmed over time.

<p>Both methods are extremely efficient and reducing waste and clearing it. The biggest difference remains in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the system, cover it, then turn it on. If it's totally complete, it will take a little while to clear through the waste, and if you discover you forgot something, you need to wait up until it's done to put the brand-new waste in.

This might sound difficult and overwhelming however doing this will more than pay for itself as you won't need to have consistent repairs and you will reduce your water costs.</p>
<p>Usually across the country, it costs in between $120 and $150 to install a garbage disposal.

If used in an incorrect area, it can become an extremely serious security hazard.</p>
<p>Repiping is performed by specialists who are specifically trained and complete most homes in 1-2 days. During a repipe, not every room will be involved in the building.
