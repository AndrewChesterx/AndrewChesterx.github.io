They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.

<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your house. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
