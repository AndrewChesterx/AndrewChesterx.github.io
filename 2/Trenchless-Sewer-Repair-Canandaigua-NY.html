<p>A. If you have rust areas, utilizing phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. If you wish to try the gentlest method maybe attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not do the trick then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and safety cautions initially!).
