New meters need to satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers may need an unique meter for their services, limiting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the building permit. Inspections need to be made after foundation excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If malfunctioning work is found, the inspector will issue an infraction notification, and a specific amount of time is set aside to fix the issue.</p>
