<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your home, this is one of the first and main questions that you need to ask yourself. The age of your home is a crucial element to understand whether or not you must repipe your home.

Each achieve the exact same task with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name indicates, the EZ Mount mechanism is planned to be simpler to handle when repairing an unit or setting up.</p>
