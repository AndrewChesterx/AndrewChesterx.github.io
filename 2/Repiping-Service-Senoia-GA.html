Water which sputters and drizzles out of faucets can be a sign that some part of your faucet is used or has been set up incorrectly. Sometimes, low water pressure is also related to more serious problems with pipes that need to be resolved prior to they become worse.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.

A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). Inspect the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
