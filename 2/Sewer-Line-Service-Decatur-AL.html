<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that should likewise be well preserved to assist prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to crack and harden or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever remains in tip-top shape.</p>
