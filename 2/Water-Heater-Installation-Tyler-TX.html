If you have kids, remind them to avoid holding on any visible pipelines or having fun with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>

Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
