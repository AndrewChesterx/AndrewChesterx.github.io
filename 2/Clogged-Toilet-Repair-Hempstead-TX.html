<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is necessary to conquer the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it may be not practical in numerous situations to install a pipe segment of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
