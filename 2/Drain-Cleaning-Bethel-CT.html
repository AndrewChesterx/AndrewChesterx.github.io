<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to business? The timing of regrowth depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water in fact requires it. When needed, newer systems use computerized sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and therefore just regenerate. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
