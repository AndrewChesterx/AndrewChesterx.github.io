So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB.

If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous.
