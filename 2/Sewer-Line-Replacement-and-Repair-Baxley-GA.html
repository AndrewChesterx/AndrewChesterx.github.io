<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
