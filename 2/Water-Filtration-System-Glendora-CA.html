<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>
