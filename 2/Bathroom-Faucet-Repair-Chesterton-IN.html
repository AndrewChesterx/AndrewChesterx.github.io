The disposer system is heavy and can be awkward to maneuver below the sink. Utilize a big bowl or other durable challenge prop up the unit as you place it. Water softeners normally have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly maintained. Ensuring the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and help eliminate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
