<p>It's a great concept to check your backflow assembly every spring when you turn your irrigation system on. However, we seldom advise CPVC when a whole home needs repiping.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
