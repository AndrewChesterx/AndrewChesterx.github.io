There are several extra reports that also explain more proof of the solidity ions in a softener's regrowth waste triggering less clogging and maintaining higher permeability than the routine septic tank effluent.</p>
<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to remove difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure called Design template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This procedure converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not adhere to any surface area in your house, keeping your devices and warm water heaters free of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners since they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove recorded ions.</p>
