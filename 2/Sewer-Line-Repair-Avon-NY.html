<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many designated usages around your home.</p>
