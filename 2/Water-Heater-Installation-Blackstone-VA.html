<p>Potassium chloride is more costly and adheres more strongly to the resin, decreasing the exchange performance when compared with sodium chloride. About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is utilized throughout the backflush operation. What we mean is that your toilet is old. Older toilets may work just great, but if your toilet is actually old (and dated in design), you might wish to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing. Modern toilets are energy-efficient and save water when you flush, which not just is great for the environment, but it's good for your wallet as well. Plus, a brand-new toilet could make your bathroom remodel sizzle.</p>
