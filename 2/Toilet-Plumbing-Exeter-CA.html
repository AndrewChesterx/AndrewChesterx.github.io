<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to leave. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down lead to a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
