<p>Leaks are tricky. While the time needed will vary based upon your home size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to reserve approximately two hours when you set up an inspection. There's constantly the possibility that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a really little plumbing system). When you call to schedule your appointment, ask how long the inspection usually takes.</p>
