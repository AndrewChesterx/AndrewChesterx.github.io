The homeowner found worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his kid.</p>
<p>If you're tired of buying mineral water and don't want to deal with nasty tasting tap water, there are several strategies you can take. The simplest is to purchase a filtered water pitcher from brand names such as Brita. These pitchers utilize charcoal filters to get rid of copper and calcium from your water, in addition to minimizing chlorine taste and odor. Merely fill the pitcher with faucet water and enable it to resolve the filter. Then, it's ready to enjoy and consume. You can also opt to install a water filter on your sink faucet.
