Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
