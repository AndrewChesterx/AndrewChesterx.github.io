<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

Costs vary based on just how much work is required. Preparing the website, digging, the trench, and filling the trench can be both time consuming and complicated.

Traditional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative impact on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and use no waste water, no salt and no electricity or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last up to 5 years without changing.
