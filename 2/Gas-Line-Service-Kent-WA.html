<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Kent WA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to eliminate hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure known as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not stay with any surface area in your home, keeping your home appliances and warm water heaters without hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners since they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And because these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>
