Required to be outdoors, no restriction on elevation of sprinkler heads, and installed 18"- 60" above grade at the set up area. If you look at your house's plumbing pipes and see spots, staining, flaking, small imprints or rust, your pipes are wearing away. Corroding pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they have not currently) and ought to be changed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Backflow preventers ought to just be fixed when the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if needed, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
