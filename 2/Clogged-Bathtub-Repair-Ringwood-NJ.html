<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or often potassium).</p>

<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>If you have a newer unit, a basic repair or replacing individual parts may be all that's required to get your hot water heater working once again. You may be lured to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this might operate in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the same product as other pipes in your house, meaning that problem might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you assurance and prevent larger leaks down the road.</p>
