It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger.
