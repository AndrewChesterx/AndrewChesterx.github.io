Oftentimes, the gas company installs, owns, and keeps the gas line and gas meter up to your house.</p>
<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they normally happen in the most affordable open drain. This type of issue is usually the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you do not identify the smell originating from the sewer backup, you may identify this issue since a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated issue with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
