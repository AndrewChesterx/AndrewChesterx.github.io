If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security preventative measures you need to require to safeguard yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
