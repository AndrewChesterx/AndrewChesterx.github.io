<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be checked yearly. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked every year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
