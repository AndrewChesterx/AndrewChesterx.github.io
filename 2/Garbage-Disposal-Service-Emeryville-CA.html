<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver lady believed the cost she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things differently might have saved her a lot of money. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
