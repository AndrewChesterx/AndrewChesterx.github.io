These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply.
