<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>When it concerns drains, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In other words, taking particular safety measures and implementing smart practices such as installing hair guards, just flushing soft, little food particles down your garbage disposal, and never ever using your toilet or drain as a wastebasket can help you prevent the majority of drain clogs and keep your plumbing running efficiently. A class action claim was settled in 2018 for Dura PEX pipes. If you experienced damage due to faulty PEX pipes, you may be eligible to sue 1st Option Plumbing's repipe experts can help you recognize damage and deal recommendations for changing the defective products.</p>
