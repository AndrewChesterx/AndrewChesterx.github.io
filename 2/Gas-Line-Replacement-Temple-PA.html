Double flush valves are ending up being a growing number of typical, as both customers and manufacturers seek brand-new ways to save water. Dual flush toilets permit the user to choose the level of water required to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is solid or liquid.

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
