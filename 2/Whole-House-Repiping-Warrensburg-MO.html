The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to escape. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
