<p>Our recommendation: Usually you'll want to opt for PEX pipes not only since they are affordable, but because they're easy and reliable to install. If you have questions about what type is pipe is right  for your house, seek advice from a plumber for more information. Connect the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the installing ring to the flange from below the sink. Make sure you snap the backup ring in location. Most toilet repairs in the Sugar Land, TX area include clogged drains, which occur when materials get stuck in the pipes.
