Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean.
