<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be gotten rid of by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin.

Once again, it is advisable to examine the manufacturer's guidelines for unique precautions.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style).

This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
