<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
