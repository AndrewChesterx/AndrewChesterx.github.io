<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal specifically designed to be used with a septic tank. offers a summary 1 of waste disposal unit and septic tanks.</p>
