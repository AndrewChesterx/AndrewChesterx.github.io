<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense might be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater. To make sure that we are supplying top quality work and client comfort, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to securely perform hot water heater replacements. In addition to standard hot water heater, we also install tankless water heaters, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
