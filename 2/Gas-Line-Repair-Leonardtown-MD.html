The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the brand-new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cable, utilizing wire nuts.

If you irrigate with potable water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and irrigation, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.
