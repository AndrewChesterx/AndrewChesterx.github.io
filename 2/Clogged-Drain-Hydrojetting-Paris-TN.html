<p>Salt intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or ecological factors necessitate restricting salt, substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride might be appropriate. Over time, the beads become covered with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regrowth process can be scheduled instantly with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another combination that can work on sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this process if it does not work the first time. We do hot water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
