<p>The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will establish. In some cases the service is to repair the broken section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is needed to fix the problem. Other times a more substantial solution is needed: repiping. PVB assembles, intended for yard watering, are the least costly kind of whole-system backflow preventer. They are reasonably basic in style and the simplest to install, keep, and repair.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
