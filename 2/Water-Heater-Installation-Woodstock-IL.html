Substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride might be suitable if health or ecological factors demand limiting salt. With time, the beads end up being coated with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has three cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regrowth procedure can be scheduled immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>You'll need an unique waste disposal unit if you home utilizes a septic system and drain field. The system should grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields.
