<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested each year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated every year to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
