<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid usually will assist eliminate them. If you want to attempt the gentlest method perhaps try using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke.
