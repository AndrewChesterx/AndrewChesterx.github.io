<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
