Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.)

For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>

As difficult water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions.
