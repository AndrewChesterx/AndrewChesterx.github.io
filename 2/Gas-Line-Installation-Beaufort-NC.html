Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need fewer repairs with time.

<p>A new hot water heater will likely last longer, provide you fewer problems, and cost you less to run over time. Sluggish drains: If you discover that your drains are emptying slower, it could be indicative of the early stages of a clog.
