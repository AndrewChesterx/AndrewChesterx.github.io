<p>If you're fairly inexperienced, a hot water heater installation is not the repair on which to sharpen your plumbing skills. So save yourself some severe trouble by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is.

Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary for the most part. Some elements such as relief valve bodies might need to be eliminated from the main body to help with a repair. Knowing the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
