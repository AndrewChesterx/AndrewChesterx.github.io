<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested annually. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be tested each year to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
