<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Independence OR</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its many intended usages around your home.</p>
<p>We provide quickly, same day service and will send an experienced professional to your home or service and do our best to guarantee that you have hot water again as quickly as possible.
