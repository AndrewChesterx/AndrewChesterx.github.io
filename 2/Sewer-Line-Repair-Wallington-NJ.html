Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes trigger poisoning, the Roman water had so much calcium in it that a layer of plaque prevented the water contacting the lead itself. What frequently causes confusion is the big quantity of evidence of extensive lead poisoning, especially among those who would have had easy access to piped water, 19 an unfortunate result of lead being utilized in pots and pans and as an additive to processed food and drink (for instance as a preservative in wine). 20 Roman lead pipe engravings provided details on the owner to avoid water theft.</p>

<p>Softened or conditioned water is excellent for your family's health. Make gas connections with strong steel pipe (Picture 8) or soft copper with flare fittings (Fig. A). Both are more reliable and less costly than versatile stainless steel connectors, which are not always permitted. Use stiff copper rather than flexible copper water supply lines for the exact same factors. Plumbing- If you are installing a toilet in a brand-new or renovated bathroom, installation may need plumbing modifications, which will increase your overall cost of installation.</p>
<p>If you find a leak and go with a patching job rather of a repiping job, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the exact same material and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire house when you identify a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
