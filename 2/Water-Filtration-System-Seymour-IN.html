<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
