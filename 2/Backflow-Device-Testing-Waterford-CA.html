<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Waterford CA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
