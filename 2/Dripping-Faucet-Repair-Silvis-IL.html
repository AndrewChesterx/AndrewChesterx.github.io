<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable supply of water and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An authorized, properly installed and preserved backflow assembly basically eliminates the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage.
