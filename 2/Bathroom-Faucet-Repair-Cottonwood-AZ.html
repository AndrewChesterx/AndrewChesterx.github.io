A visual point of recommendation will help our provider work more efficiently. For outstanding quality repiping services in your area, trust the team that puts their consumers first.

<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
