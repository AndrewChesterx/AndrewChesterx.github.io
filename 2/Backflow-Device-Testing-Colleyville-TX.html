<p>Leakages are sly. While the time required will differ based on the house size and the variety of discovered breakdowns, it's best to set aside up to 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's always the opportunity that your plumber's previous task will run long and postpone the starting time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the job (unless you have a very small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection normally takes when you call to arrange your consultation.</p>
<p>Align the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange underneath the sink. Press it into location, and loosely protect it by rotating the lower mounting ring onto the ramp tabs of the upper installing ring. Rotate disposer unit as needed to align drain assembly.

Garbage disposals are a vital part of a smoothly running kitchen. If you don't already have one, you need to be persistent about not letting food decrease the drain.
