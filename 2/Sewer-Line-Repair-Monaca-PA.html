<p>Replacing the ring that seals the connection between the sewer and the bowl line suggests entirely eliminating the whole toilet. So it's a. good time to think about getting a brand new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
