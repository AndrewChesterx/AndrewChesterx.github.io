<p>The next action for an aspiring plumbing contractor is to earn a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing company and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors normally consist of paying an application cost and passing a detailed service, law and building code examination. Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools offer contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Extra requirements for potential plumbing business owners may consist of evidence of monetary credibility, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
