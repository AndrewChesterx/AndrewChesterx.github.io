Every system may not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing technique to backflow security.

Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
