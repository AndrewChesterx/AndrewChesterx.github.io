<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet efficiency- The higher the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The effectiveness of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Houses that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing.
