But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
