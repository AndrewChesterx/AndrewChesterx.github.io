It generally represents rust and mineral accumulation if you discover low water pressure or discolored water. As rust and minerals develop in time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, affecting the water quality.

<p>The term difficult water" might seem like an oxymoron, but it's simply household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to drink. They also are relatively undetectable through smell or taste, however they can be hazardous just the same.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that need to also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to crack and harden or just be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
