<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models.
