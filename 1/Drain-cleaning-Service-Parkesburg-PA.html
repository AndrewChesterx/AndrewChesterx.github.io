<p>You'll need to have the backflow valve tested every year going forward if you're having a new yard irrigation system installed.

<p>The term tough water refers to water with a high mineral material. These minerals can differ depending upon which area of the nation you remain in, but many frequently include calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Tough water does not begin hard-- instead, it picks up mineral deposits as it is available in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for residential and commercial use, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
