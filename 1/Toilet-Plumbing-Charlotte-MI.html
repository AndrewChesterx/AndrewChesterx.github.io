PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and was in broad usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a range of materials and fittings employed.</p>
