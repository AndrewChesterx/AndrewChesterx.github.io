About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is utilized during the backflush operation. What we suggest is that your toilet is old. Older toilets may work just great, however if your toilet is actually old (and dated in style), you might wish to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing. Modern toilets are energy-efficient and conserve water when you flush, which not just is great for the environment, however it's good for your wallet also. Plus, a new toilet could make your bathroom remodel sizzle.</p>
