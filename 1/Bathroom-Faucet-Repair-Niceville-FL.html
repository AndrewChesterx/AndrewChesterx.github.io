<p>Those people in the market understand that cross-connection programs in numerous areas have actually greatly reduced the number of reported events that occur within our water systems. This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever actually have actually been an issue in the first location. This thinking can be both counterproductive and harmful. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a reduced pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing method to backflow protection. We need to look at each installation for the threat it presents and after that install the appropriate protection.</p>
