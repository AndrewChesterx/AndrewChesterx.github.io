<p>A. We highly advise a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers obstruct any water from negative or back pressure in your watering system at shutdown from going into back into your water source, hence decreasing the danger of contamination of your water source. Numerous towns require the use of an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You may wish to check with your local municipality before installing your watering system.</p>

A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without hampering water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
