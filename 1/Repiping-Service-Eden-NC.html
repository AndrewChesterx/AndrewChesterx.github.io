<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
