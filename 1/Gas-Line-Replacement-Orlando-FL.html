<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
