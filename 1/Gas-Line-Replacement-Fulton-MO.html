<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to get away.
