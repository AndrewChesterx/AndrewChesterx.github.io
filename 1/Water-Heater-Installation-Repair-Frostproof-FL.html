<p>Irrigation backflow devices are designed for installation on potable water lines to safeguard against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of infected water into the safe and clean water system. While there's not an exact schedule regarding when you need to repipe your home, you should absolutely look into repiping if they have not been carried out in 50 years or more-- especially if you live in an older home developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our ac unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe exactly what was wrong with the unit, how he fixed the issue, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly advise Hunter for any concerns you may have.</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their equivalents in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are likewise required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
