<h3>Clogged Sewer Line in Wilmington Massachusetts</h2>

<p>Minnesota has a growing problem with chloride in water. Chloride in water threatens our fresh-water fish and other water life. The chloride used in house water softeners can likewise affect the water used for drinking. It takes only one teaspoon of sodium chloride salt to permanently pollute five gallons of water. There is no simple method to remove it when salt is in water. A backflow preventer is a device developed to keep water inside fire-protection and other water-based systems on a property-- guaranteeing it just travels in one instructions: from the water pipe into the system's pipes.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

<p>Badly installed gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines need to be adjusted to the right levels by a certified professional. They responded quickly for my sewer leak. Jay B and Aaron scoped the task rapidly and discussed the strategy for diagnosis and repair. They kept me educated and persevered through very challenging sewer line clean-up and repair. I will recommend SW plumbing for any significant repair work.</p>
