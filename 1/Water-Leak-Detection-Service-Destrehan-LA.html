If brand-new work is carried out such as replacement of gas piping, a strategy might be essential to obtain the license.

<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system as the result of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure. This decrease in supply pressure occurs whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water pipe).

A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
