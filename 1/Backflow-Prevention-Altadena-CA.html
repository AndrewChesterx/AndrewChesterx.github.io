<p>It's a good concept to check your backflow assembly every spring when you turn your watering system on. However, we seldom recommend CPVC when an entire home needs repiping. The pipes can become brittle, over time, and may need replacement earlier than hoped. Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may also require a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing normally needs an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board to find out more.</p>
