<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
