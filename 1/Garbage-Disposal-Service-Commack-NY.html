<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Making sure plumbing equipment such as lawn sprinkler and fire pumps are separated to their own particular networks is important in order to preserve drinkable water safety. Read our reviews to see what people are saying about our hot water heater services. It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has required several repairs over the last couple of years. An excellent rule of thumb for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the typical hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Is your hot water heater making sounds or leaking water? Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning at (913) 432-3342 for expert Merriam water heater services.

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested every year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an every year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system.
