<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the watering system.
