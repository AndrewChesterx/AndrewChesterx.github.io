The unit chosen for a provided installation should be suitable for the system style and website conditions, including consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to happen.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
