If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you ought to require to safeguard yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
