This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close.

To avoid further breakdowns, house owners should stay up to date with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
