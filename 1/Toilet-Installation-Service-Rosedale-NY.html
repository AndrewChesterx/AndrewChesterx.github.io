A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
