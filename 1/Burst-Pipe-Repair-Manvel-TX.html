<p>A freshly set up hot water heater must not produce odd noises, but it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things worsen significantly for households with a high need for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. A water heater replacement might be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed.</p>
