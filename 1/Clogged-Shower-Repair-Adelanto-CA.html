<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
