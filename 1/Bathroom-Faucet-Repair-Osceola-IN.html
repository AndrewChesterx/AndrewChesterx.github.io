It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.
