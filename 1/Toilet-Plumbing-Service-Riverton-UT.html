<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. An RP works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to separate health or nonhealth risks.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
