<h3>Water Heater Plumbing in Severn Maryland</h2>
<p>The US Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, next to cooling and heating. The quantity of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs. As you home ages the water taking a trip through your pipes gathers more sediment. This is why repiping your house makes sense.

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be tested yearly. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested every year to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
