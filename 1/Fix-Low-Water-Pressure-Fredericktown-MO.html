Water softeners generally have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are correctly maintained. Making sure the salt water tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the system. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and help ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
<p>Those people in the industry know that cross-connection programs in many locations have greatly lowered the number of reported occurrences that occur within our water supply. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever truly have actually been a problem in the first place. This thinking can be both unsafe and detrimental. Backflow events in water systems are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a reduced pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the risk it provides and then install the appropriate defense.</p>

You might need to look into using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
