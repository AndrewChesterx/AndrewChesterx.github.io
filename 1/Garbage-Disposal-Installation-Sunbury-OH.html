<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
