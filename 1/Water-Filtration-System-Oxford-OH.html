<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur.
