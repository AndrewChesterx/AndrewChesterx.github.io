If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This rust can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
