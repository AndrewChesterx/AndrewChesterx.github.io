<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
