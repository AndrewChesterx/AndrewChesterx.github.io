New meters must satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas providers may need a distinct meter for their services, limiting your choices.

Inspections must be made after structure excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before hiding work), and upon conclusion. KEEP IN MIND: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will issue a violation notification, and a specific amount of time is allotted to fix the issue.</p>
