<p>If a gas water heater or an electrical unit is more cost-effective, house owners frequently ask. The response depends upon your house. While gas designs are less costly to run, they do require an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electric water heater is typically lower, but it can be more costly to operate. Electric varieties are likewise simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.

<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak right away and sometimes those leaks come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
