We had some household coming to stay for graduation weekend and we needed a brand-new hot water heater before they showed up. We shopped around for a bit, but we got the best quotes from Blue Frog. They were able to send out somebody out within a day or so. He was great and very friendly. He stated our costs must be lower now too.</p>
