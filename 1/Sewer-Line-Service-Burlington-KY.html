The customer has thirty days to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (examine the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer.

<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
