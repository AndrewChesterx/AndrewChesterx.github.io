<p>If  you're tired of living with the side-effects of difficult water, a water softening system from RainSoft can offer you with the option you need. Since we initially opened in 1953, our water softeners have made a distinction in the lives of numerous homeowners in The United States and Canada and worldwide. Our premium system, the EC4 whole house water softener, is a state-of-the-art product that uses a process of ion exchange to eliminate the minerals that cause tough water. By replacing the bicarbonate, magnesium, and calcium ions that trigger water solidity with sodium or potassium ions, the EC4 softens tough water by addressing its source. Moreover, thanks to its distinct, built-in microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your normal water use patterns, adjusting its soft water shipment based upon your needs.

<p>In community water supply systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to flow to and out of the plumbing components in your house or service. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation occurs, infected water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention technique used. The best and safest kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>

It is necessary to know how to care and keep for your all your house's plumbing components and systems to keep things running efficiently.</p>
