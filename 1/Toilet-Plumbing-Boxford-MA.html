<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank.

The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>
