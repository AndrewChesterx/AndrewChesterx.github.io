<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
