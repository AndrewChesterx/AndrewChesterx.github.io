<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the technique set out above. Because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
