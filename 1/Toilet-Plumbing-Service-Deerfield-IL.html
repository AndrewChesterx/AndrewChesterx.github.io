<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Deerfield IL</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

To prevent such an event, there requires to be some kind of backflow prevention method used. The very best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is needed.

Using the incorrect fitting might cause a blockage or leak.</p>
