<p>Salt-free systems will likewise reduce scale buildup and provide brighter clothing and softer skin utilizing a much healthier approach. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without needing to add salt to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Traditional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative impact on individuals with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no drainage, no electricity and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last as much as 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be replenished on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
