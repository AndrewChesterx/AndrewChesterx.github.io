<p>Pipe Relining - This is a cost-efficient option to fixing pipes. Instead of digging, replacing, and making a mess of your yard, pipe relining includes utilizing a specialized resin to replace the damaged pipe. Our technicians will place a resin-saturated felt tube, which permits the resin to harden and form a new, strong pipe within the harmed pipe.

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect over time, they slowly begin to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, affecting your water quality.</p>
