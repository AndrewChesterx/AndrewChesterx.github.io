<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they restore whether the resin needs it or not.

Such models are hassle-free if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
