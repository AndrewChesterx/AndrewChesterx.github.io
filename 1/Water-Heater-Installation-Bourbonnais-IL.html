<p>A newly installed water heater should not produce strange sounds, but it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things worsen drastically for homes with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>

When it comes to summer season, one thing is constantly sure - the weather will be hot. Luckily, our knowledgeable cooling professionals at Casteel provide emergency repair, regular maintenance, and new installation services to property owners all over.</p>
