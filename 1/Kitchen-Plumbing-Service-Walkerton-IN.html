<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
