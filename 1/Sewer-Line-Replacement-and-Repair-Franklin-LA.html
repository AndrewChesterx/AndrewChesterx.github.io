Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. You can repeat this process if it does not work the first time. We do hot water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
