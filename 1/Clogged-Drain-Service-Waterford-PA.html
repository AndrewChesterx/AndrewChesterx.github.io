As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many designated uses around your house.</p>
