<p>Those of us in the industry know that cross-connection programs in many areas have greatly minimized the number of reported incidents that occur within our water supply. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever really have actually been a concern in the very first place.

Every system might not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or nothing technique to backflow security. We need to look at each installation for the danger it presents and after that install the correct defense.</p>
