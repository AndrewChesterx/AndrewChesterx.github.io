<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly use an element that warms up water when the tap is switched on. The water is continuously warmed as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being heated. The heating temperature level is usually pre-set to fit your preferences and needs. Because they just heat water when needed, tankless electric water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
