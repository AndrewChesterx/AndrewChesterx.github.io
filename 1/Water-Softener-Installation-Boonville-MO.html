After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its new area and positioned there. So if your water heater requires repairs and you reside in Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Williamsburg, Yorktown, Suffolk, Portsmouth, Tabb, Grafton, Smithfield, James City County, or Hampton Roadways, all you have to do is call on A-1 plumbers to repair it for you.
