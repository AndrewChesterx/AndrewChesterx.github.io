Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines because pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>
<p>It is common for hot water heater to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve is part of the unit for that precise reason. But while small drips ought to not be trigger for concern, property owners ought to keep an eye on the water heater leakages. All significant plumbing code bodies deal with defense versus backflow in potable supply of water systems. All potential or existing cross connections should be secured from backflow by the installation of a proper backflow prevention device.
