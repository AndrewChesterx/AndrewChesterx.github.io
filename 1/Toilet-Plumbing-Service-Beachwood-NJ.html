<p>Journeyman plumber: Once the requirements of an apprenticeship are fulfilled, plumbers can get a journeyman license. Many employees in the plumbing industry are journeymen.

Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
