This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
