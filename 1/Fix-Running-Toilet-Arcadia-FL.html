While there's not a specific timetable regarding when you ought to repipe your home, you should certainly check out repiping if they haven't been carried out in 50 years or more-- particularly if you reside in an older home built closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe just what was wrong with the unit, how he fixed the problem, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly recommend Hunter for any problems you might have.</p>
