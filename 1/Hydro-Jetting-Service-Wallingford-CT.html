We have all the parts necessary to fix your toilet. It only takes a short time if we have to purchase them.

This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
