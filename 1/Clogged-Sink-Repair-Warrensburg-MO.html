<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house.

A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Examine the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
