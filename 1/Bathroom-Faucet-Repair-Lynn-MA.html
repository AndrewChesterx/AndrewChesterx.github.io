<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
