<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet performance- The greater the performance of the toilet, the more it costs. The performance of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Both approaches are highly efficient and decreasing waste and clearing it. The most significant difference remains in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the system, cover it, then turn it on. If it's entirely full, it will take a bit to clear through the waste, and if you find you forgot something, you need to wait till it's done to put the brand-new waste in. Due to the fact that we desire to spare you tension while saving you cash, we provide high-quality work. It's why our workmanship is ensured, why we offer flat rates for repair jobs, and why we never charge overtime-- even on nights and weekends. We offer more than a quick fix-- after a single check out, you can have total assurance that we have completely fixed your gas line problem.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two indicators of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they slowly start to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>
