<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

Water will discharge till the supply side pressure again exceeds the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
