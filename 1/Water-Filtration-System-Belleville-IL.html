<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Belleville IL!</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
