<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your home.

Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
