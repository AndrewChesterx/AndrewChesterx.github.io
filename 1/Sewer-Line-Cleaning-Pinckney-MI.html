<p>Lubrication may assist with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the professional put together the parts into the body without creating damage from friction.

Making use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out quicker by attracting dirt and debris or limiting the motion of the element.
