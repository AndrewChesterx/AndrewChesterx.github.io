In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly.

The disposer unit is heavy and can be uncomfortable to maneuver below the sink. Utilize a big bowl or other tough object to prop up the unit as you place it. Water softeners normally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are properly kept.
