<p>As water heaters age, specifically when they approach the decade mark, you might begin to discover some issues. Any kinds of strange sounds usually recommend problem. Popping noises, for example, suggest that the water is boiling (which should never ever take place). Sediment accumulation or a defective thermostat represent common reasons for boiling water.

Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
