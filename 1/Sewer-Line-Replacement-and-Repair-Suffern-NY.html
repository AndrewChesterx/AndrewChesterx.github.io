<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. An RP works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be utilized to separate health or nonhealth risks.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
