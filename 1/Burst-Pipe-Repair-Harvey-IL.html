The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.

Because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles however will lose more water and salt.
