<p>Since it is versatile and light-weight, plastic pipe is a commonly utilized material. Its seamlessness makes it an excellent product for installation in unsteady environments.

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style).

This process continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
