I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
