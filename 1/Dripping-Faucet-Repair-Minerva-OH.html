<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested each year. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked each year to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
