This is especially typical after returning from a holiday or not using your home's supply of water for a prolonged period of time. If this takes place only when your hot water is running, it may be because of a corroded hot water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house.</p>
<p>Blockages are quickly prevented with a couple of crucial actions. Location drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers catch hair, food and other debris before it gets stuck, avoiding the need of drain cleaning. Although they don't capture whatever, it helps the system significantly.
