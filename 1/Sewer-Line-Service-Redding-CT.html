Soft water feels noticeably smooth to the skin. It also makes your home simple to clean by minimizing hard-water accumulation. High water pressure likewise damages plumbing. The water coming into the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water turned off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure results in leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to occur without correct pressure reduction.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
