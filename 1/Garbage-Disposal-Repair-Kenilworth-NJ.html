Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
