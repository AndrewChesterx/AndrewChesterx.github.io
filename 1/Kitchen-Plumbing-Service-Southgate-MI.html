<h3>Blocked Sewer in Southgate MI - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>

If this occurs just when your hot water is running, it might be because of a rusty warm water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house.</p>
<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the beginning of our house improvements. George and Anthony did an incredible job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our home. I will constantly use them and ask for George specifically for all future concerns or repairs. They were timely and gave excellent rates for what we required done. I highly recommend this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin has actually already been fouled. Again, it is recommended to check the producer's guidelines for special preventative measures.</p>
<p>Depending upon the type of work that we are doing near your home or company, there may be an amount of time that your gas will be off so that we can complete repairs.
