<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Millis MA</h3>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
