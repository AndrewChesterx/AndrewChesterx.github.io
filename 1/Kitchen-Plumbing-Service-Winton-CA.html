When it pertains to the problem of hard water, a traditional water softener really eliminates calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with small quantities of what is referred to as temporary hardness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
