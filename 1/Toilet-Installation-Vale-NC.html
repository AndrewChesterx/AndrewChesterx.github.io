<p>Those people in the industry know that cross-connection programs in many areas have actually significantly decreased the number of reported occurrences that happen within our water systems. This has at times led to people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever really have been a concern in the very first location. This thinking can be both harmful and counterproductive. Backflow events in water systems are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow defense. We need to look at each installation for the risk it presents and after that install the proper defense.</p>

An electric water heater might take a complete hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater could heat twice that quantity in the same given time and possibly much faster.</p>
