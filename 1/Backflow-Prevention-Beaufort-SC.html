<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>

If your system is getting near to 10 years old, it's typically not wise to pay for repairs if they are worth more than half of the price of a brand-new unit.
