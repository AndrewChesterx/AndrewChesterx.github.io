If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you should require to secure yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
