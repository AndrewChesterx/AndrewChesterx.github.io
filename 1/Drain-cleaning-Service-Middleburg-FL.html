<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs.
