If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home.

A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve.

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Since water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
