<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
