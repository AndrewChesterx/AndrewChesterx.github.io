<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water circulation, happens. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to get away. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
