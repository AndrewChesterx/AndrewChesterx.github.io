<p>Once the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly.

Repiping now will offer you peace of mind and prevent larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
