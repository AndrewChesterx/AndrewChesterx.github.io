<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily stored for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
