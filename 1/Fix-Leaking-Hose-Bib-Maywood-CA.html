<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any remaining pollutants.</p>
<p>Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the lifetime of some devices. Water softening is usually attained utilizing ion-exchange resins.
