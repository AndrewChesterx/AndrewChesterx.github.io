<p>Watering backflow devices are developed for installation on potable water lines to safeguard against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the drinkable water supply.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
