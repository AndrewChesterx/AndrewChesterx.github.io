As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many desired usages around your home.</p>
