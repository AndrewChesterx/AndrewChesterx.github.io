<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Waterford CA?</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
