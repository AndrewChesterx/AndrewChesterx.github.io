Age-- As we pointed out, a 10+ year old water heater is most likely on its last legs.

Usually, the very first 2 numbers indicate the year of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Obviously, it's always easier to avoid obstructions in the very first location. If you have a kitchen waste disposal unit, don't overload it. Feed items in a little at a time, and wait till they grind and run through entirely prior to including more.

It's important to know how to care and maintain for your all your house's plumbing components and systems to keep things running efficiently.</p>
<p>Water heater repair can often be cost-prohibitive. You'll spend for the essential repairs just to deal with another problem quickly thereafter. Constantly continue to run water throughout and after using your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
