Kinetico Premier Series softeners are comprised of multiple tanks and constructed for fast water flow to ensure you receive a continuous supply of soft, clean water.</p>
<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to remove wastewater from websites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the earliest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily detachable and changeable sections, and enabled cleaning.</p>
<p>Another annoying problem is when the flush valve in the tank fails or wears out. If you hear the toilet running constantly or occasionally you probably need the valve or float changed.

Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the drab gray triggered by difficult water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, fixing, changing and servicing our softener. Appreciate the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has actually repaired the issue we were having.</p>
