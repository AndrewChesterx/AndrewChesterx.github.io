<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Remove the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water.
