<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
