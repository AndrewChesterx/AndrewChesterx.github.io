If your DIY dig hits a natural gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a threat of fire or explosion damage to your residential or commercial property or your next-door neighbor's. Another risk in sewer repair tasks is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your safety and health are too essential to run the risk of in a Do It Yourself sewer project!
