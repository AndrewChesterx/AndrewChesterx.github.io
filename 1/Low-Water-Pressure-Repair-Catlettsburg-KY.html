<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out yearly forward flow tests are often perceived as a required to have them. However the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.

<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
