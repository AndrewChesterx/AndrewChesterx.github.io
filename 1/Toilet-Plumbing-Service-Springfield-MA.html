The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to get away. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
