<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to access to in-wall pipes, consider at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets must absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
