Lots of blockages are caused by putting excessive toilet paper into the bowl. Know just how much toilet paper your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever put any paper product into the toilet bowl other than toilet paper. Paper towels can quickly block the toilet drain line or trigger a clog further down the drainpipe. Womanly hygiene products need to be dealt with in the garbage and never ever in the toilet.</p>
