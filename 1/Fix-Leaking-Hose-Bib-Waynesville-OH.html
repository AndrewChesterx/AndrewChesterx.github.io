<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
