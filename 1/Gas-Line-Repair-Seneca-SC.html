<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Seneca SC Plumbers</h3>
<p>Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is totally odor-free. The egg smell associated with natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you must require to protect yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
