This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it may be impractical in many circumstances to install a pipe sector of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
