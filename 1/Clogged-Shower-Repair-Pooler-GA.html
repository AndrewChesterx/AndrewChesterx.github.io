<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is specifically susceptible to repeating pinhole leaks (deterioration that breaks through the surface area of piping), so watch out for bluish-greenish deterioration on copper piping.

All leaks, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>

More recent units utilize computerized sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just restore when needed. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
