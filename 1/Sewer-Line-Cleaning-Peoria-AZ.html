<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>

<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the safe and clean supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An approved, appropriately installed and maintained backflow assembly basically removes the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any substantial modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electrical option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
