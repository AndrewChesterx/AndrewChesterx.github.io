<h3>Elizabethtown PA Experts In Unclogging Drains</h3>

<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, inspect the instructions. After installing the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>

He switched off the water supply to the house, removed the corroded system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Before leaving the house, the technician brought back water circulation and evaluated the pipe.</p>
