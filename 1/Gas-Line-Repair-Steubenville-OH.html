<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively be part of your project requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads.

We need to take a look at each installation for the danger it provides and then install the correct defense.</p>
