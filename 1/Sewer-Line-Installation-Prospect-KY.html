<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
