<p>Hard water stops washing detergents and cosmetic cleansers from working as successfully. When washing items are used in difficult water - difficult water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. If you experience blockages and backups in your home more than a couple of times, it's a good concept to have a professional assess your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to examine your drain system. Often, if you have numerous drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can locate and recognize the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to help avoid leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and split or just be so crushed that it does not fill the area in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
