<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Paola KS</h3>

When you flush the toilet, pressurized water is forced into the bowl, blasting waste down the drain.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.
