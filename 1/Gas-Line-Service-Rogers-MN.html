When tree roots begin to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems.

<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It might not be set up in any place where it may ever be immersed under water. Some municipalities do not allow the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some do not permit the usage of a PVB at all, so consult your water company. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it should be installed in a location where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
