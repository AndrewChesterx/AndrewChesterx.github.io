<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

If you water with potable water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are also needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
