<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to get rid of wastewater from websites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the earliest known examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily detachable and changeable segments, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>The check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire protection market, producing a redundancy designed to guarantee that a person check valve will continue to safeguard the city supply of water even if the other stops working. This assembly likewise makes it possible for the closure of one valve to minimize the pressure differential throughout the other, developing a more reliable seal and preventing even minor backflow leak. Test cocks, or small ball valves, enable the attachment of testing equipment that evaluates whether the double check assembly is functional.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the issue if this is the case. You might have to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
