Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A waste disposal unit is an essential kitchen home appliance in many homes today. While many kitchen sink disposers can handle nearly any kind of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other things jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inadequate, increasing the risk of drain blockages.</p>

To remove the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise till the system falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
