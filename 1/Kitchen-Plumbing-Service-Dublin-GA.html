If you want to put new pipes in your house or you're developing a house, there are 3 kinds of new plumbing pipe available that are building-code approved for homes-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride). PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are outstanding options to the costly copper piping.</p>

<p>Backflow prevention gadgets are designed to protect the general public water supply from cross-connections. A modern neighborhood supply of water system is created to make sure that water flows to residential or commercial properties and buildings under pressure. If there is a cross-connection in between the water supply and a contaminated source, this neighborhood water network consists of lots of users where there is a risk to public health.
