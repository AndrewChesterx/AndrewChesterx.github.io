<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if required, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop.

For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to split and harden or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape.</p>
