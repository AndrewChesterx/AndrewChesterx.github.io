<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
