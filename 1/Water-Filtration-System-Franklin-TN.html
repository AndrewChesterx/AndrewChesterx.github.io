Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use.

<p>Because it is versatile and light-weight, plastic pipe is a commonly used product. Its seamlessness makes it a great material for installation in unsteady environments.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that ought to likewise be well maintained to assist prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and break or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in good shape.</p>
