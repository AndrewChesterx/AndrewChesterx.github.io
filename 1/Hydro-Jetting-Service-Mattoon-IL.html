<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when freshly restored. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Difficult water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to decrease these symptoms.</p>
