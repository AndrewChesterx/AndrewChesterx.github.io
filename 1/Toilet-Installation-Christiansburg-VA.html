<h3>Blocked Drains in Christiansburg VA - Various Tools Used</h3>

Examine the sewer lines from residential or commercial property to suppress connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to thoroughly inspect if pipe damage, rust, or major obstructions are present. Tree roots are among the most significant reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots enter into the drain line they can trigger blockages and back up into your house.</p>
