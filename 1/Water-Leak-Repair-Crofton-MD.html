<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of utilize the method set out above. Because the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
