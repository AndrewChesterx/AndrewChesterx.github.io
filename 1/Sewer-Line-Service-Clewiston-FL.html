<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions.
