<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
