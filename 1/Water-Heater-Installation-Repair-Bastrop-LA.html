<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may seem like a waste of money. Why purchase professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick?

Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for homeowners. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.
