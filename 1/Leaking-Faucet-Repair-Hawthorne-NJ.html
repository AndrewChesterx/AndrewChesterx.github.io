<p>Your sewer line problem can lead to sewer backups, and they typically occur in the lowest open drain. This type of issue is typically the outcome of a clog in the line. If you don't spot the odor coming from the sewer backup, you might recognize this problem due to the fact that a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
