These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never ever precisely matches supply.
