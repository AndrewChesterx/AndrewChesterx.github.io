<p>Sadly, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often becomes destructive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas water heaters with special venting systems also are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
