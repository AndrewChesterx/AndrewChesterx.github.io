<p>When managed early, all of these issues are simple and common to deal with. By calling Bell Cow at (844) 234-2355 upon first discovering a problem, you can avoid more serious concerns caused by leaks, like structural damage. Do not get milked by your water costs either!

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
