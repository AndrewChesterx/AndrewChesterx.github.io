<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate gradually, they gradually begin to constrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you notice it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>
