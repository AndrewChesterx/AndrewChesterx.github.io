<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly.

<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they typically occur in the lowest open drain. This kind of issue is normally the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you don't find the odor originating from the sewer backup, you may identify this problem due to the fact that a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated issue with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
<p>Another bothersome issue is when the flush valve in the tank stops working or wears out. If you hear the toilet running continuously or periodically you probably need the valve or float replaced.  Stopping working to repair a running toilet can lead to wasted water and a really high water costs. Water in Florida is pricey so don't postpone-- get a running toilet repaired. Fixing it might be best if your water heater is only a couple of years old and just has a minor problem.
