These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply.
