<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply.
