A repair service will help determine whether this holds true.</p>
<p>Water softeners leaks are mainly triggered since of a concern at the point of installation or due to the fact that of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly.

A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely split and just requires to be replaced.</p>
