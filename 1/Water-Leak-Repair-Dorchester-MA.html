Secure the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hoses should have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the devoted drain. An air gap may be utilized to attain this, and might be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
