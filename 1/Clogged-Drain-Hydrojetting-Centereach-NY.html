<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's become troublesome, or just for a make over? How about for a structure addition or major remodel? As soon as once again, that's something you might do yourself, although it's normally better to employ a skilled sink plumber in the San Diego area.

It can be difficult comparing cut outs and component holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with everything sealed up.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation.
