<p>She knew about the service call cost. The 4 On Your Side Investigation discovered that's a typical charge. Customer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would provide an estimate over the phone. All of them wished to take a look at the situation before committing to a price, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
