<p>An rdc resembles a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer consisting of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it generally does not consist of shutoff valves, may or may not be geared up with test dicks or ports, and is generally less reliable than a DC. An rdc works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but must be used to isolate just nonhealth hazards and is planned for usage only in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>Cooking oil and other greases must never ever be put down the garbage disposal since they can impede the blades. Finally, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from getting in the waste disposal unit, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
