<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>As toilets get older, they have to work more difficult to do their jobs. Harder work suggests more water. Even if your toilet works effectively, it's also possible that it's simply an old design that utilizes a lot of water.

The new low-flow toilets work just as successfully as any other type of toilet, and you'll conserve an unexpected amount on your bill.</p>
