<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Gibsonia PA</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
