<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Chicago IL</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>
