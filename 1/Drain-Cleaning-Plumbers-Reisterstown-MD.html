Prior to salt starts operating in a water softener it needs a little residence time within the reservoir, given that the salt is liquifying gradually. When one immediately begins regeneration after adding salt to the tank, the water softener may not work according to requirements. After an approval of plans has actually been provided and the assembly has actually been set up, it needs to be tested by a certified tester. The designer (or water supplier) is then responsible to certify that the installation was performed in accordance with approved plans; or describe any changes or send "As Built" prepares as proper.</p>

It is also permitted to use black iron if it is probably covered with a galvanized finishing (which is basically a special paint"). PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
