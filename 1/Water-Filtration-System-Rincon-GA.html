<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
