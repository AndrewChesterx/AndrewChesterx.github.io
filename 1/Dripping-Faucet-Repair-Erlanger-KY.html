The effectiveness of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Houses that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based).

An individual who breaches a provision of the code, who stops working to adhere with any of the requirements thereof, or who erects, install, alters, or repairs plumbing operate in offense of the approved building and construction documents or instruction of the enforcing company, or an authorization or certificate provided under the provisions of the code will be examined a fine in accordance with the act and 2002 PA 733, MCL 338.3511 to 338.3569.</p>
