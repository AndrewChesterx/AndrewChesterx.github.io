<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are caught and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>The most reliable method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
