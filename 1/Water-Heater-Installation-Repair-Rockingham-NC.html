Using too much lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or use out sooner by attracting dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the component.

Many guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures. To prevent additional malfunctions, property owners should keep up with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
