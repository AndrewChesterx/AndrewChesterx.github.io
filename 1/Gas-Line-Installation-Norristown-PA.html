<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience blockages in numerous drains simultaneously in your home, then that normally implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in numerous locations and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine.

<p>Sluggish drains. A slow drain can be a common plumbing concern, and many obstructions can be fixed with a simple fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the basic unclogging methods don't work to fix the sluggish drain, the concern can be a much deeper blockage someplace in the main sewer line. Unfortunately, mainline clogs are usually much bigger obstructions than need more than basic unclogging approaches, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>The drains in the average house get constant usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other particles can slowly build up over time. The drain will slowly slow till it becomes entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in shops have actually limited efficiency. Although the drain may appear to clear initially, the outcome is often temporary and the clog soon returns. Using these chemicals often can cause damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
